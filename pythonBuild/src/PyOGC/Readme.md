What is PyOGC?

	  PyOGC is a wrapper for the wonderful libogc library for developing
	programs for the GC/Wii in Python.

Why PyOGC?

	  I can think of a few reasons: GC/Wii needs more language support,
	C/C++ is nice, but not always the best solution.  When squeezing every
	last drop of performance out of a system isn't an issue, Python is an
	excellent language for rapid, simpler development.  Python support on a
	popular console gives inexperienced programmers a good entry point
	without having to learn too many technical details.

What can it do?

	  It's still a little limited now, but the ultimate goal will be to do
	everything that libogc can do, but in a more Pythonic way (read: not
	necessarily the most efficient, but more logical/straightforward way).
	Currently, the frame-buffers/console can be set up, audio samples
	played, GC pads read, threads can be ran, SD cards can be utilized, and
	there is some early Wii remote support.

I'm convinced, how do I start?

	  Look at the included demo, its meant to demonstrate most current
	features, look at the code, wait for good documentation, or all of the
	above.
